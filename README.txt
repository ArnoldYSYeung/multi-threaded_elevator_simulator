LAST EDITTED: NOV. 19, 2015 - 2:40 PM

DESCRIPTION: - ELEVATOR 1 IS CONNECTED TO DISPATCHER 
	     - NO SEMAPHORES USED
             - ELEVATOR 1 LOOPS READING AND CHANGES WHEN NEW COMMAND ENTERED
		INTO IO
	     - IO CAN INSTANTANEOUSLY READ ELEVATOR 1 STATUS FROM DATAPOOL
	     - SEMAPHORES BETWEEN DISPATCHER AND ELEVATOR 1 IMPLEMENTED
	     - SEMAPHORES PLACED INSIDE IF-STATEMENTS SO THAT 1 KEYBOARD
		INPUT -> 1 OUTPUT FROM DISPATCHER -> 1 OUTPUT FROM ELEVATOR
	     - SEMAPHORES BETWEEN IO AND ELEVATOR 1 IMPLEMENTED 
	     - ALGORITHM PROTOTYPE 1 COMPLETED - SORT AND SEND COMMAND BASED
		ON TARGET ELEVATOR 
	     - ADDED STOP_FLOORS[] ARRAY TO MARK FLOORS THAT THE ELEVATOR
		NEEDS TO STOP AT
	     - ALGORITHM PROTOTYPE 2 COMPLETED - MAILBOX STORES COMMAND FROM
		IO AND IMMEDIATELY SEND IT TO ELEVATOR 1 THRU PIPELINE
	     - ALGORITHM PROTOTYPE 3 GOING - INSIDE ELEVATOR COMMAND SENDING
		INSTRUCTION COMPLETED FOR ELEVATOR 1
			- DOES NOT INCLUDE INTERPRETING COMMAND BY ELEVATOR 1
			- DOES NOT INCLUDE OUTSIDE COMMANDS
	     - ALGORITHM PROTOTYPE 3 GOING - ELEVATOR 1 (WHEN NOT MOVING) CAN
		TAKE DIRECTION BASED ON INPUTTED COMMAND FOR INSIDE COMMANDS
	     - MOVING ELEVATOR 1 - ELEVATOR 1 MOVES BASED ON DIRECTION
			- MOVES 1 FLOOR EVERY INPUT COMMAND
			- MAILBOX HAS TROUBLE SORTING STORED COMMANDS - NO ALGORITHM
				IMPLEMENTED YET (NEED ALGORITHM WHICH PRIORITIZES CLOSEST
				FLOOR)
	     - MOVING ELEVATOR 1 - ELEVATOR MOVES AUTOMATICALLY
	    		- MAILBOX QUEUES COMMANDS (DOES PRIORITIZE CLOSEST FLOOR THOUGH)
	     - FAULTS INCLUDED FOR ELEVATOR 1
	     - CODE EDITTED - UNNECESSARY COMMENTS REMOVED
	     - ELEVATOR 2 ADDED IN AND WORKING
	     - UP DOWN COMMANDS ADDED
	     - BASIC GRAPHICS ADDED - POSITION OF ELEVATORS 1 AND 2 SHOWN DYNAMICALLY
	     - ELEVATOR 1 STOPS FOR A LONGER TIME WHEN IT REACHES A REQUESTED FLOOR
		- NOT IMPLEMENTED INTO ELEVATOR 2 YET
	     - ELEVATOR 1 DOORS OPEN WHEN ARRIVE AT FLOOR AND CLOSES
		- DOORS OPEN AT SAME FLOOR IF SAME COMMAND IS ENTERED (I.E. ELEVATOR DOES NOT MOVE)
	     - DOORS OPENING IMPLEMENTED FOR ELEVATOR 2
	     - INCLUDED FAULT CASES FOR WHEN DETERMINING WHICH ELEVATOR SHOULD TAKE OUTSIDE COMMAND
	     - EE - ELEVATOR 1 RETURNS TO BOTTOM FLOOR
	     	- NEW COMMANDS ARE IGNORED 
	     - EE - ELEVATOR 2 IMPLEMENTED
